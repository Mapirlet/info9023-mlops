# INFO9023 - Machine Learning Systems Design

The course of Machine Learning System Designs (or MLOps) aims at enabling students to truly build fully functional "user-ready" ML applications. It will look at the whole lifecycle of building a real world ML application, from a technical and functional perspective. At the end of the course, students will be familiar with key tools and frameworks of MLOps.

We are in the early days of the AI revolution, which is expected to bring a large impact to many industries. There is a large demand for skilled engineers who are able to build ML applications.

Bringing a Machine Learning application to production requires many more efforts than solely the ML model development. Famously, there is a large hidden technical debts in designing and implementing all the components coming around your model.

This course and material contained in this repo aims at closing that technical debt by providing essential tools and best practices in MLOps.

The material is not meant to be challenging but rather try to bring a maximum of concepts in an assimilable and enjoyable way for students.

## Course pillars

The objective of this course is to provide the following:

- **Theory**: Fundamental concepts of MLOps. Why is it important, framework, type of implementation, best practices, …
- **Technical skills**: Labs are there to show how to use key basic tools of ML Engineering.
Tools are chosen based on popularity, being open-source and ease of utilisation.
- **Project**: We will apply the theoretical and technical learnings on one large group project.
The project will empower you to build applications in a creative way.
- **Engaging**: Always discuss!
Goal to have interactive classes and labs. The classes are built to follow a healthy tempo, to be engaging, frequently give time for open questions, group discussions... and of course the (not so) occasional meme.
