# INFO9023 - Machine Learning Systems Design

The course of Machine Learning System Designs (or MLOps) aims at enabling students to truly build fully functional "user-ready" ML systems. It will look at the whole lifecycle of building a real world ML application. At the end of the course, students will be familiar with key tools and frameworks of MLOps.

We are in the early days of the AI revolution, which is expected to bring a large impact to many industries. There is a large demand for skilled engineers who are able to build ML systems.

Bringing a Machine Learning application to production requires many more efforts than solely the ML model development. Famously, there is a large hidden technical debts in designing and implementing all the components coming around your model.

This course and material contained in this repo aims at closing that technical debt by providing essential tools and best practices in MLOps.

## Course culture

#### Pillars
1. **Relevant**: Focused on core concepts of building ML applications. Tailored choice of current best practices.
2. **Practical**: Concrete Labs, resources, real life examples, time to experiment, support line, …
3. **Engagin**: Interactive class session. Healthy tempo (break out exercises, QA, …). … And lots of memes.

#### Learning Streams
There are 3 points of learnings for students following this course:
1. **Lectures**: Present theoretical concepts and practices. Usually the first part of each class.
2. **Labs**: Labs are there to learn how to use key tools widely used to build ML systems. They've been cherry picked based on usability, performance, popularity and accessibility. 
3. **Project**: You will apply the theoretical and technical learnings in one large group project. You will build a ML application in an engaging way - you're in the driving seat.
